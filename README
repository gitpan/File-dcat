NAME
    dcat - IO_DIRECT version of cat

SYNOPSIS
	dcat /path/to/file /another/file

DESCRIPTION
	Sometimes, when dealing with large files, you do not want
	to spoil your OS file cache with them. Those times this small utility
	comes to you.

CAVEATS
	It definatly works only on FreeBSD, on Linux O_DIRECT works only with
	aligned reads, so YMMV.
